# SCT_ML_1
A linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms:
House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. 

Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn


Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook housepriceprediction.ipynb 


Follow the instructions in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Train a linear regression model using features (GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath) to predict house prices (SalePrice).

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Make predictions for new data points.
